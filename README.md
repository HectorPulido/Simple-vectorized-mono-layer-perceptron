# Vectorized monolayer perceptron

This is a simple perceptron made with [Simple Linear Algebra for C#](https://github.com/HectorPulido/Simple_Linear_Algebra) , is a neural network that can calcule Xor Xnor And Or via Stochastic gradient descent backpropagation with Sigmoid as Activation function.

There is a lot to improve, like csv read, gpu implementation, regularization, but is functional.
 
## How use it
Just go to the project and open Program.cs

## Where can i learn more
On my Youtube channel (spanish) are a lot of information about Machine learning and Neural networks
